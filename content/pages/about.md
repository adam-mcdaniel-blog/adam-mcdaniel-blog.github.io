I'm a musician, [programmer](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel), and college student. I've been developing software in Python, Rust, C++, and many more different languages for several years now.

## Programming

Compiler and programming language design is my favorite subject in computer science. I have an unending fondness for Lisp, Forth, Brain****, and SKI combinator calculus.

Although most of my work is in compiler design, I love to write other kinds of software. See my [resume](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/resume) for more detail about the other projects I've worked on!


## Music

In my free time, I love to play guitar. I've been playing since about 2016, and I was instantly hooked. Although I've never published any music, sometimes I like to write my own songs.

My favorite kinds of music include psychedelic, classic, and art rock. I love Pink Floyd and The Beatles.

## Interests

I'm incredibly interested in business related projects, and science. I used to be really into video games, but I rarely play them at all anymore. During high school, I was lead member of my robotics team. There I developed an interest in 3D printing and working with hardware.

I'm also extremely interested in chess. My [lichess](https://lichess.org) account is [adamthekiwi](https://lichess.org/@/adamthekiwi). I like to say that my peak blitz chess rating was 2161 (quite literally a chess master rating), but it was out of sheer luck that I ended up beating three ~2000 rated players in a row when I first started. My actual blitz rating (5 minute games) is about 1500, and my rapid rating (10 minute games) is about 1400.

In fact, I'm so passionate about chess that I wrote my own cross platform engine. You can play it right here in the browser!

## Polyglot

My favorite language is the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org), but I'm also very experienced with [Python](https://python.org) and [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/). Python was my first language, but now I almost exclusively deal with systems level languages; I just prefer the control and speed of working with Rust and C++. In total, I know: Rust, C++, Python, Golang, and Nim.
