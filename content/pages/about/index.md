My name is Adam McDaniel. [I'm a musician, programmer, and graduate student](https://adam-mcdaniel.github.io/). Python was my first programming language, but I'm a RustaceanðŸ¦€ at heart.

## Programming

I started programming in middle school during the 7th grade. At first, I was fascinated with making games. I wrote some terrible ones using Pygame. Some of them used sockets to implement multiplayer functionality as well. In high school I joined the FIRST robotics competition team my freshman year, and continued through my senior year. We used Python to write our robot code. During my sophomore year, I became enthralled with the concept of different programming paradigms and programming language design. During my junior year, I implemented a functional programming language named [Maroon](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/maroon). I also wrote several other toy languages at the time, including [Tsar](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/tsar) which is a dynamically typed, ahead of time compiled language which could transpile to both Rust and Go backends.

I started college at the University of Tennessee in fall of 2020, and graduated with my Bachelor's degree in December of 2022. Currently I'm a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree.

## Music

I've played guitar since 2016, and I play often. I love the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, the Temptations, and Aphrodite's Child. Anything somewhat bluesy or psychedelic is right up my alley. In particular, [666 by Aphrodite's Child](https://open.spotify.com/album/2lWDphDAlgk8PNdODreJwv?si=_SmyNGqiRyyl6ib1HxcKoA) has likely been my favorite album throughout the past year.

## Linguistics

I'm very interested in how languages are related to one another: it's fascinating to me how languages evolve. I'm also interested in constructed languages, like [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona). It's fun to assign spoken languages to different programming languages as well: Java is certainly Vulgar Latin, JavaScript is English, x86 is a Pidgin, and C is Classical Latin. Additionally, I'm proficient enough in Spanish to enjoy books, shows, podcasts, and movies in the language. I try to practice at least an hour a day listening to Spanish content in some form or another.

## Chess

My [lichess](https://lichess.org) account is [adamthekiwi](https://lichess.org/@/adamthekiwi). I like to say that my peak blitz chess rating was 2161 (quite literally a chess master rating), but it was out of sheer luck that three ~2000 rated players in a row resigned early when I first started.

I also wrote my own cross platform engine which runs anywhere. You can play against it right here in the browser!
